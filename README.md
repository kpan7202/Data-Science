# DotA2 Prediction Model

This repo shares the idea of applying general data science principles to DotA 2 dataset.
Dataset consists of the statistics of DotA 2 v7.05 matches, which was retrieved from STEAM API.
The main idea is to build a model to predict the outcome of a match given the heroes composition in each team.
